    <h1>Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        "Auto Biography:"
        <strong>Anne Frank</strong>
        "Written By"
        <em>Anne Frank</em>
        "This autobiography is about how a young girl transforms into a young teenager.<br>
        She goes through mental changes and vents her discomforts and cares about the world<br>
        and her unfortunate circumstances. Although she is young and innocent she knows a lot<br>
        about life. It is absolutely incredible how she can perfectly convey her feelings straight <br>
        onto paper, it is so touching."
    </p>
    <p>
        "Anne Frank goes through so much during her time in the secret annex. She talks about her crushes<br>
        and what food she eats. What things she looks forward to, and things she's afraid of. She writes about<br>
        her family and how she personally gets along with each one of them. Through her roller coaster ride of <br>
        feelings she makes the best out of the worlds biggest nightmare. "

        "I have read this book in middle school a while back. I had repurchased this book because I didn't quite <br>
        remember the story anymore. This was a book I fully enjoyed, despite the tragedy of her story, I feel I <br>
        appreciated it more the second time around more than the first."

        "This is a quote by Anne Frank:"
        <q>
            "I must uphold my ideals for perhaps the time will come when I shall be able to carry them out."
