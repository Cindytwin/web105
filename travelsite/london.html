                <h2>Big Ben</h2>
                <p>Iconic to this cities landscape Big Ben is the nickname to that of Great Bell. <br>
            In 2012 it was renamed to Elizabeth Tower to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, the "current queen" of<br>
             the United Kingdom. This tower was designed in the Neo-Gothic era by Augustus Pugin. This fine building stands at<br>
            315 feet. An interesting fact is that the dials measure to 23 feet in diameter. Another fact would be that is uses it's <br>
            original victorian mechanics but a motor is used as back-up if the original mechanism fails that day.<br>

            <h2>London Eye</h2>
            <p>Although I am deathly afraid of heights I could not pass up a chance to see The London Eye. <br>
                This structure is also popular for it's nickname but it's original name is "Millennium Wheel".<br>
                 This by far the most popluar tourist attraction of London. It welcomes about 3 million visitors a year! <br>
                It reaches a height of 443 feet tall and 394 feet in diameter! It is the world largest cantilevered observation wheel.<br>
                
            </p>
            <p>When you are in Euroupe I think you definetly need to search for that perfect cup of joe. <br>
                One of the most popular places is "Kaffeine" it is a cafe serving up all sorts of fine lunches and drinks.<br>
                 It's mondern color pallet and chique style welcomes it's customers to a warm and inviting space. <br>
                I have never been their either so I can't say much personally about their coffee so the google pictures are what I depend for my "review".<br>

                <p>I have also searched for the best book store, of course, because I love to read. So this is what I have found.  <br>
                    London- Hatchards Piccadilly, if I am pronouncing it correctly. This quaint, and homie establishment offers an assortment of litriture. <br>
                     Childrens books and Novels can be found here, and what would a book short be without it's sales of trinkets and cozy nooks and corners to<br>
                    curl up and read abook. <br>
