                <h2>Cherry Blossoms</h2>
                <p>The Cherry Blossom Tree in Tokyo are very popular in Japan culture. <br>
            In Japanese they call this tree "Sakura". They incorporate this flower into drinks food and much more.<br>
             There is also a big festival in the spring time held for the blooming of these gorgeous trees.<br>
            If you didn't know these trees blanket most if Japan but they also come in many varirties. <br>
            These flowers die rather quickly, so if you ever plan on visiting the day of the festival is held; be sure to arrive promptly.<br>
            I think by far the most interesting fact about this marvelous tree is that the oldest Sakura tree is over 2,000 years old. It's circumference is<br>
            13.5 meters. It's name is "Jidai Zakura". You can find it in the Jissou Temple in the Yamanashi Prefecture.

            <h2>Sky Tree</h2>
            <p>Sky Tree if you didn't know is an observation and broadcasting tower. Tokyo Skytree is located in Sumida, Tokyo.<br>
                In 2011 it became the tallest tower in the world at 2,080 feet. Now it remains the second tallest after Burj Khalifa.<br>
                 The structure is similar to that of a tripod, it's cylindrical top was designed to offer views to the river and to it's beautiful<br>
                city scape. This fantastic building also features a glass floor located at the upper observatory level where tourists can peer down<br>
                at Tokyo below their feet. Because Tokyo, and most of Japan is prone to earthquakes, it was built to withstand such interferences.<br>
                In the center of the building a concrete shaft was built to renforce the outer structure. This shaft is also attached ot to the fame work<br>
                and other parts that cushion the building when it shakes.
            </p>
            <p>In Japan you can find many foods as well, but the best food you can find is perhaps in Tokyo! <br>
                Tokyo offers many cuisines from all over, but what they're popular for is Ramen and Sushi.<br>
                 If you enjoy a good bowl of Ramen you might need to wait in line for a good resturant or have a seat<br>
                at a sushi bar. Not a bar like in the states but a bar where the sushi passes by your table on a convayor belt.<br>
                For the best sushi in Tokyo you should visit "Sushi Saito" it's pricey but definetly worth the price for a flavourful bite.<br>
                For the best ramen in Tokyo you should visit "Fuunji" this is a more affordable place in serves a variety of ramens.

                <p>Although I haven't been personally to this wonderful city I would love to visit their spa's!<br>
                    Now in Japan people choose to relax and wind down at a bath house. This is were you can relax in hot water,<br>
                     perhaps grab a bite to eat and socialise with friends or family. You and your family can also stay here it comes<br>
                    with a complementary breakfast. Most modern bath houses will come with activities such as games and a dinning area.<br>
