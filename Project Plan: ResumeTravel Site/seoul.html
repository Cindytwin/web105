                <h2>Food Markets</h2>
                <p>Probably the most popular food markets you can find in Seoul is the Gwangjang Market <br>
            This traditional street market is the oldest and largest in South Korea. There you will see over 5,000 shops<br>
             and over 20,000 employees! Thats so mind blowing! Not really but it's impressive non the less. <br>
            
        </p>
            </aside>
            <h2>Banpo Bridge</h2>
            <p>Banpo Bridge stands over the Han river, and connects Seocho and Yongsan districts. <br>
                This bridge is interesting because it is a double deck bridge. An interesting feature about this bridge<br>
                 is that it has a water fountain installed into it's sides. It shoots out aproximetly 190 tons of water per minute!<br>
                The water comes from the river itself. At night you can catch a show of the Rainbow lights when the fountain turns on.<br>
                
            </p>
            <p>Of course I had to look up a coffee shops here too! <br>
                This mondern mixed with traditional style coffee shop is located in Seoul as well.<br>
                 Namusairo Coffee offers an indoor experience as well as an outdoor area, located in the center of the builing. <br>
                Cute and yummy treats are sold here and you could also have teas and coffees, served warm or cold.<br>
